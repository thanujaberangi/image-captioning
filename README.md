# image-captioning
Generates captions for given images using techniques from computer vision and natural language processing (NLP).
I worked on an ML-based project called 'Image Captioning Using Natural Language Processing and Neural Networks.' Our team focused on creating a system that automatically generates captions for images, combining technologies from Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing."
"The project aims to convert images into meaningful text. We used a deep learning model, specifically combining ResNet50 for image feature extraction and an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network for caption generation. ResNet50 helps the model understand the image's visual features, while LSTM helps in generating natural language captions."
"First, we extract features from images using ResNet50, Then, we use GloVe word embeddings to represent captions as vectors, and an LSTM network processes these vectors to generate meaningful text. The model was trained using a dataset of images and their corresponding captions from Flickr8K."
ResNet is designed to solve a major issue with very deep CNNs called the vanishing gradient problem,ResNet introduces skip connections (also called residual connections), allowing the model to "skip" certain layers so that it can maintain strong gradient flow during backpropagation. Better Accuracy for Complex Images.
after extracting features from an image using ResNet50, the model needs to generate captions (text). The captions are made up of words, and GloVe is used to represent these words as vectors. This allows the model to understand the semantic meaning of words and how they relate to each other. After ResNet extracts the image features and the words are represented using GloVe vectors, the LSTM network generates captions word by word. For example, after seeing part of the caption, like "A dog is", the LSTM can predict the next word based on the image features and the words it has already seen, completing the caption as "A dog is playing."
The LSTM network helps ensure that the generated captions are grammatically correct and make sense by maintaining context from the previous words in the sequence.
"In conclusion, this project has potential applications in areas like social media automation, visual search, and content management. The CNN LSTM architecture we used can be further enhanced for even more accurate results.‚Äù
